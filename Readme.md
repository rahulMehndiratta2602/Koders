## To start the server

Make sure that port 4000 is not in use .
Go to the root directory "Koders" and type the following command:
`npm install`
Once the installation is done Start the server using the command:
`npm start`

## To start the client write these commands in a different terminal other than the one where server is running.

`cd client`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Go to (http://localhost:3000) to see the frontend.

Note : I have provided the dot env file in the repository. And I will change the credentials by tomorrow to prevent misuse of information.

I hope you will like it. I had still 4-5 features left to implement, but considering the time constraint and it was getting hard to do both backend and frontend side by side in considerably low time, I decided to submit.

However I follow the principle "Dont stop when you are tired ,Stop when you are done :) "
